\title{Linear Trading Rules for Portfolio Management ${ }^{1}$}

Active portfolio management balances expected returns, the risk of positions, the costs of trading, restrictions on position and trades, and the uncertain way these aspects of the task shift over time. It is a complex problem, so any portfolio management system is at best a compromise. It will make an approximation here, ignore a facet there, concentrate on this, and hope for the best with that-as much art as science.

If we tried to describe the portfolio management challenge with a mathematical model, we would end up with a large constrained dynamic unsolvable stochastic optimization problem. There is, however, a special case where large dynamic stochastic optimization problems are easy to solve. If the objective is quadratic, the process is unconstrained, and the expected returns predictions and portfolio positions change in a linear manner it is called a linear-quadratic dynamic program, LQDP. In a LQDP the optimal policy is summarized by a linear trading rule that tells us our revised positions should be a linear function of our current positions and of other variables that are predictors of returns.

If a linear trading rule is optimal in a special case, then it should be good in a more general case. Our plan is to take that notion and see where it leads. We will start with a linear trading rule and ask what it tells us about the evolution of our portfolio, how the linear trading rule can be improved, and how the linear trading rule can be employed in the context of a more traditional structured portfolio management process.

}

We take the perspective of a portfolio engineer. We have design criteria, say a level of risk and a level of turnover, and subject to those criteria we use linear trading rules to obtain the best possible exposures to the sources of excess return (aka alpha).

Our examination of linear trading rules is based on a dynamic view of portfolio management. We put dynamics at the center of our analysis and hope that the reader will adopt that perspective even if the specific results are ignored.

We start with a description of linear trading rules and stress the crucial role of the trading rate. Then we examine the assumed flow of information about future returns, the rate it arrives, and the rate its forecasting power declines. With a known framework of information flow and a linear trading rule we are able to describe the expected evolution of the portfolio. Simulation results confirm that those predictions are accurate. A sensitivity analysis shows how important predictions change as we vary the trading rate. That sensitivity analysis invites us to tune the linear trading rule to fit our design criteria. One would like to say the linear trading rule is being optimized, but that is too ambitious. In our role as portfolio engineers we should recall that the best rough guide is still a rough guide. In the rough-guiding spirit, we show how the insights we have gained from the study of linear trading rules can be folded into a traditional single or multistage portfolio optimization to give it a dynamic flavor.

The key takeaways are the importance of a dynamic perspective, the crucial role of the trade rate, a systematic procedure for transactions costsensitive signal weighting at the asset level, and transformation of a single or multistage optimization into a dynamic (i.e., extremely long horizon) optimization.

There are two technical appendices. Appendix A establishes the link between the linear trading rule and important metrics such as exposure to sources of alpha, risk, turnover, transactions cost, and the efficiency of our risk allocation. Appendix B describes the optimality of linear trading rules in a related dynamic programming problem. This analysis is the motivation for the linear trading rule and the adjusted signal weights used to calculate the model/target position. Appendices A and B are similar to Appendices B and A (respectively) of the signal weighting paper (Chapter 9 in this book), although appendices to this chapter use a single asset bottom-up approach rather than a top-down portfolio approach.

A multistage optimization possesses many of the same features as a dynamic program. See Boyd et al. (2017) for a tour de force. Our suggestion for augmenting a single stage optimization holds for multistage as well. Linear-quadratic dynamic programming (LQDP) was developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s. There is no shortage of literature on LQDP; an Internet search yields about 360,000 hits. For application to portfolio management from an academic perspective see the work of Garleanu and Pederson (2013) and other papers cited there. The approach we have taken is similar to the simulation/optimization algorithm described in Powell's excellent book (2011). This paper is in a similar spirit as some of the author's
earlier work. The first, Grinold (2005) (Chapter 7, "Implementation Efficiency," in this book), was an effort to get at the factors that determine a portfolio's transfer coefficient (see Clarke et al. 2002). In Grinold (2007) (Chapter 8, "Dynamic Portfolio Analysis" in this book), we used LQDP to examine the loss in return, from both direct costs and opportunity costs. The effort in Grinold (2010) (Chapter 9, "Signal Weighting," in this book) considered multiple sources of alpha and used LQDP to address the question of signal weighting. This paper takes those ideas from the theoretical/strategic level to the practical/operational level, by asking how linear trading rules can help us manage portfolios.

This chapter follows a different route from the published article. We use a bottom-up approach to signal weighting. For each asset we start with standardized signals, map these into alphas, then to a model position.

As always, the results could be made more complicated. But if we recall that it is better to learn to walk before we try to run, then it is best to start with a case that is both accessible and useful. Once we have mastered the basic idea we can elaborate. In particular, for simplicity we focus on predictions of specific return where information about company A does not tell us anything about company B. This means that the expected covariance between the A and B positions will be zero even if the returns on assets A are $B$ are correlated.

This study, like any other, is based on assumptions that are at best an approximation of reality. We do not know each asset's specific risk, and that elusive specific risk changes over time. Information does not arrive regularly or smoothly. Information that is asset specific is also an ideal. In a zero-sum situation, good news about A is bad news for B . In a win-win framework, A's success is a portend of B's flourishing. The reader can doubtless come up with additional caveats. It can't be perfect.

\section*{Linear Trading Rules}

Given a starting position and a desired target, we move part of the way toward the target because trading is expensive and it is a moving target.

The linear trading rule is:
$$
\begin{gather*}
\begin{array}{c}
\left.\begin{array}{c}
\text { position } \\
\text { of asset } n \\
\text { at time } t
\end{array}\right\}= \\
\left.\begin{array}{c}
\delta_{n}(t)
\end{array}\right)\left\{\begin{array}{c}
\text { position } \\
\text { of asset } n \\
\text { at time } t-\Delta t
\end{array}\right\}+\left(1-\delta_{n}\right) \cdot\left\{\begin{array}{c}
\text { target position } \\
\text { of asset } n \\
\text { at time } t
\end{array}\right\} \\
=\delta_{n} \cdot p_{n}(t-\Delta t) \\
\\
\delta_{n} \equiv e^{-d_{n} \cdot \Delta t} \leq 1 \\
d_{n} \approx 1-\delta_{n} / \Delta t
\end{array},+\left(1-\delta_{n}\right) \cdot m_{n}(t)
\end{gather*}
$$
where $d_{n}$ is the trade rate for asset $n$.

We can also view the linear trading rule in integral and differential form:
Differential Form
$$
\dot{p}_{n}(t) \equiv \frac{\Delta p_{n}(t)}{\Delta t} \approx d_{n} \cdot\left\{m_{n}(t)-p_{n}(t)\right\}
$$

Integral Form
$$
p_{n}(t)=\left(1-\delta_{n}\right) \cdot \sum_{\tau=0: \infty} \delta_{n}^{\tau} \cdot m_{n}(t-\tau \cdot \Delta t)
$$

The continuous time version of the model generally yields results that are simpler and more revealing. For example, the differential form of the linear trading rule says that we trade to close the backlog, $m_{n}(t)-p_{n}(t)$, with the trade rate, $d_{n}$, indicating how hard we push to close the gap. From the integral form we see that the current position is a weighted average of past target positions. If we calculate the average age in this weighted sum, we find it approximately equal to $1 / d_{n}$ years; thus if $d_{n}=3$ we are on average four months behind the model/target.

\section*{Information Flow}

Information comes from $J$ sources. It is expressed as signals that have, in the long run, mean zero and standard deviation one. The signals have two properties of note: their strength (ability of forecast) as measured by an information ratio, $i_{j}$, ${ }^{2}$ and their persistence as measured by a half-life, $H L_{j}$. The half-life tells the number of trading days it would take for the current signal to lose one-half of its forecasting power. We capture the half-life in three ways, as explained below.

252 trading days/year, 21 per month, 63 per quarter
$\Delta t=1 / 252$ years
$H L_{j}$ number of days until the signal losses $1 / 2$ its strength
$$
\begin{aligned}
& g_{j} \equiv \frac{252 \cdot \ln (2)}{H L_{j}} \text { the rate of loss } \\
& \gamma_{j} \equiv e^{-g_{j} \cdot \Delta t} \text { the fraction of information retained in one period } \\
& g_{j} \approx 1-\gamma_{j} / \Delta t
\end{aligned}
$$

\footnotetext{
2. Note that this symbol $i$ for the information ratio is different from the symbol $\iota$ for the information coefficient that appears later in the chapter.
}

The law of motion for the signals is:
New Signal $=$ Retained Old Signal + New Informatior
$$
\begin{equation*}
s_{n, j}(t)=\quad \gamma_{j} \cdot s_{n, j}(t-\Delta t) \quad+\sqrt{1-\gamma_{j}^{2}} \cdot \tilde{y}_{n, j}(t) \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$
where $E\left\langle\tilde{y}_{n, j}(t) \mid s_{n, j}(t-\Delta t)\right\rangle=0$ and $E\left\langle\tilde{y}_{n, j}^{2}(t)\right\rangle=1$
We use this form to bring out the special properties of the information arrival and decay process. The random part of the new signal, the $\tilde{y}_{n, j}(t)$, is for asset $n$, signal $j$ at time $t$. The random part has mean zero, standard deviation of one. It is new information and therefore uncorrelated with last period's signal, $s_{n, j}(t-\Delta t)$. Under Equation (2), the long run mean and standard deviation of signals will be, respectively, zero and one.
Our effort is concentrated on predictions of each asset's specific return. We assume that the information we have on one asset does not predict the future return on other assets. However, we will allow for correlation among the signals for any individual asset. The signals inherit this correlation from the correlation of the new information. ${ }^{3}$
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \phi_{i, j} \equiv \operatorname{Corr}\left\langle\tilde{y}_{n, i}, \tilde{y}_{n, j}\right\rangle \text { then } \\
& R_{i, j} \equiv \operatorname{Corr}\left\langle\tilde{s}_{n, i}, \tilde{s}_{n, j}\right\rangle \approx \frac{\sqrt{g_{i} \cdot g_{j}}}{\frac{g_{i}+g_{j}}{2}} \cdot \phi_{i, j}
\end{aligned}
$$

A basic idea from Grinold and Kahn (2000) is to transform disparate types of asset characteristics into portfolios subtly called characteristic portfolios. We let the characteristic portfolios interact using the rules of variance and covariance. It is an apples-to-apples approach.

In our case we want to transform the signals into positions. There are $N$ assets and we use $\sigma_{n}$ to denote the specific risk of asset $n$. The resulting positions are $b_{n, j}(t)$ and they link with the signals according to the following rule:
$$
\begin{equation*}
b_{n, j}(t)=\frac{s_{n, j}(t)}{\sigma_{n} \cdot \sqrt{N}} \Rightarrow E\left\langle\sigma_{n}^{2} \cdot b_{n, j}^{2}(t)\right\rangle=1 \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
$$

Division by the specific risk is justified since, (i.) to go from signal to alpha you multiply by the volatility and (ii.) to go from alpha to position you divide by variance. The use of the number of assets to scale the risk is a placeholder, since the weight will be assigned later depending on the trade rate.

\section*{Prediction and Simulation}

The trade rate, $d_{n}$, and the linear trading rule yield predictions of important portfolio outcomes. The predictions are governed by three schemes for

\footnotetext{
3. The ratio of signal correlation to the correlation of the innovations is the ratio of a geometric mean to an arithmetic mean. It is generally less than one and equal to one only when the decay rates are equal.
}
weighting the $J$ signals. Each of the three weighting schemes is a $J$ element vector. They are:
- the zero-cost weights $q_{n}(t), \mathbf{w}_{\mathcal{Q}(n)}$,
- the weights for the model (target) position, $m_{n}(t), \mathbf{w}_{M(n)}$, and
- the resulting weights for the position, $p_{n}(t), \mathbf{w}_{P(n)}$.

We find the zero-cost weights from first principles as in Grinold and Kahn (2000). See Appendix A of this chapter for details. The zero-cost weights depend on the assumed information coefficients of the sources, $\mathbf{l}_{n}=\left\{\boldsymbol{l}_{n, j}\right\}_{j=1: J}$, for asset $n$, the variance penalty parameter, $\lambda$, and the correlation of the signals, $\mathbf{R}_{n}$, through the equation:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{l}_{n}=\sigma_{n} \cdot \lambda \cdot \mathbf{R}_{n} \cdot \mathbf{w}_{\mathcal{Q}(n)} \tag{4}
\end{equation*}
$$

The risk penalty, $\lambda$, adjusts the scale. As the subscript $n$ implies all of these quantities can be asset specific.

The zero-cost risk allocation and the positions, $b_{n, j}(t)$, determine the zero-cost positions, $q_{n}(t)$, and the asset alphas, $\alpha_{n}(t)$ :
$$
\begin{align*}
& \text { (i.) } \quad q_{n}(t) \equiv \sum_{j=1: j} b_{n, j}(t) \cdot w_{Q(n), j}  \tag{5}\\
& \text { (ii.) } \quad \alpha_{n}(t) \equiv \lambda \cdot \sigma_{n}^{2} \cdot q_{n}(t)
\end{align*}
$$

To get the model/target weights for asset $n, \mathbf{w}_{M(n)}$, we use the trade rate, $d_{n}$, and the decay rates of the signals:
$$
\begin{align*}
& \psi_{n, j} \equiv \frac{1-\delta_{n}}{1-\delta_{n} \cdot \gamma_{j}} \approx \frac{d_{n}}{d_{n}+g_{j}}  \tag{6}\\
& \Psi_{n} \text { a } J \text { by } J \text { matrix with } \psi_{n, j} \text { on the diagonal }
\end{align*}
$$

According to the logic of Appendix B that describes the dynamic program for one asset and $J$ signals, we obtain the following weights for the target:
$$
\begin{equation*}
w_{M(n), j}=\psi_{n, j} \cdot w_{\mathcal{Q}(n), j}, \quad \text { or } \mathbf{w}_{M(n)}=\Psi_{n} \cdot \mathbf{w}_{Q(n)} \tag{7}
\end{equation*}
$$

In Appendix A, we establish the link between the model/target weights, $\mathbf{w}_{M(n)}$, and the resulting effective position weights for the asset, $\mathbf{w}_{P(n)}$. The resulting weights are a direct consequence of the linear trading rule, Equation (1), and the law of motion of the signals, Equation (2). The relationship is:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{R}_{n} \cdot \mathbf{w}_{P(n)}=\Psi_{n} \cdot \mathbf{R}_{n} \cdot \mathbf{w}_{M(n)}=\Psi_{n} \cdot \mathbf{R}_{n} \cdot \Psi_{n} \cdot \mathbf{w}_{Q(n)} \tag{8}
\end{equation*}
$$

A handy way to think about this is when the signals are uncorrelated. Then we have $w_{P(n), j}=\psi_{n, j} \cdot w_{M(n), j}=\psi_{n, j}^{2} \cdot w_{\mathcal{Q}(n), j}$. There is a twofold contraction of the risk allocation. For very fast signals this can be dramatic.

\subsection*{An Example}

The signals with names, half-lives and information coefficients are detailed in Exhibit 1. In this example, and in all of our calculations, we have assumed, for convenience only, that the information coefficients, $\mathrm{l}_{n}$, and correlations,
$\mathbf{R}_{n}$, are the same for all assets, thus the zero-cost weights, $\mathbf{w}_{\mathcal{Q}(n)}$, are the same for all assets. ${ }^{4}$

\footnotetext{
4. In general, the signals will vary in nature and strength in sectors and/or industries, for very large stocks and very small stocks, for highly liquid stocks and stocks that are hard to trade. etc. The bottom-up asset by asset approach we are using is an ideal way to exploit this information. However, this elaboration is a distraction from our stated goal so we will not use it in our examples.
}

EXHIBIT 1 Assumed Signal Properties
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ NAME } & HL (DAYS) & INF. COEFF. \\
\hline FAST & 2 & 0.1785 \\
\hline INT & 63 & 0.0313 \\
\hline SLOW & 189 & 0.0223 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

In the example, the variance penalty is $\lambda=25$, and there is some slight correlation, $\mathbf{R}_{n}$, between the signals, enough to prove the concept but not enough to dominate the results. The asset's specific volatility is $15 \%$.

To illustrate the three weighting schemes, we've included an example using the data in Exhibit 1, Equations (6) through (8), and a trade rate $d=3$. The time interval is one trading day, $\Delta t=1 / 252$.

EXHIBIT 2 Risk Allocations When the Trade Rate Equals 3
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$\boldsymbol{d}_{\boldsymbol{n}}=\mathbf{3}$} & $\mathbf{w}_{\boldsymbol{o}}(\boldsymbol{n})$ & $\mathbf{w}_{\boldsymbol{m}}(\boldsymbol{n})$ & $\mathbf{w}_{\boldsymbol{p}}(\boldsymbol{n})$ & $\boldsymbol{\psi}_{n j}$ \\
\hline FAST & 0.1070 & 0.00421 & 0.000282 & 0.0393 \\
\hline INT. & 0.0313 & 0.01110 & 0.005860 & 0.5226 \\
\hline SLOW & 0.0223 & 0.00926 & 0.007200 & 0.7659 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The FAST signal is too fast for this trade rate. The signal weight drops by more than two orders of magnitude from the zero-cost to the portfolio level.

\subsection*{The Expectations}

With risk allocations $\mathbf{w}_{\mathcal{Q}(n)}, \mathbf{w}_{M(n)}, \mathbf{w}_{P(n)}$, we can calculate the following expectations:
- the alpha:
$$
\alpha_{P(n)} \equiv E\left\langle\alpha_{n}(t) \cdot p_{n}(t)\right\rangle=\lambda \cdot \sigma_{n}^{2} \cdot \mathbf{w}_{Q(n)}^{\prime} \cdot \mathbf{R}_{n} \cdot \mathbf{w}_{P(n)}
$$
- the target variance:
$$
\sigma_{M(n)}^{2} \equiv E\left\langle\left\{\sigma_{n} \cdot m_{n}(t)\right\}^{2}\right\rangle=\sigma_{n}^{2} \cdot \mathbf{w}_{M(n)}^{\prime} \cdot \mathbf{R}_{n} \cdot \mathbf{w}_{M(n)}
$$
- the covariance:
$$
\sigma_{M(n), P(n)} \equiv E\left\langle\sigma_{n} \cdot m_{n}(t) \cdot \sigma_{n} \cdot p_{n}(t)\right\rangle=\sigma_{n}^{2} \cdot \mathbf{w}_{M(n)}^{\prime} \cdot \mathbf{R}_{n} \cdot \mathbf{w}_{P(n)}
$$
- the variance:
$$
\sigma_{P(n)}^{2} \equiv E\left\langle\left\{\sigma_{n} \cdot p_{n}(t)\right\}^{2}\right\rangle \approx \sigma_{n}^{2} \cdot \mathbf{w}_{M(n)}^{\prime} \cdot \mathbf{R}_{n} \cdot \mathbf{w}_{P(n)}
$$


- the backlog variance:
$$
\sigma_{M(n)-P(n)}^{2} \equiv E\left\langle\left\{\sigma_{n} \cdot\left[m_{n}(t)-p_{n}(t)\right]\right\}^{2}\right\rangle \approx \sigma_{M(n)}^{2}-\sigma_{P(n)}^{2}
$$
- the variance of $\dot{P}(n)$ :
$$
\sigma_{\dot{P}(n)}^{2} \equiv E\left\langle\left\{\sigma_{n} \cdot \frac{\Delta p_{n}}{\Delta t}\right\}^{2}\right\rangle=d_{n}^{2} \cdot \sigma_{M(n)-P(n)}^{2}
$$

The approximations, $\approx$, are for the case where $\Delta t$ is small, that is, where $g_{j} \approx\left(1-\gamma_{j}\right) / \Delta t$ for all $j$.

The volatility of the position derivative, $\sigma_{\dot{P}(n)}$, with the nearly imperceptible dot over the $P$, is key to calculating the expected turnover and transactions cost per year. With an assumption that the trades are normally distributed ${ }^{5}$ we can calculate the expected annual turnover (purchases plus sales divided by two) for asset $n$ is:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\tau_{P(n)} \equiv \frac{1}{2} \cdot E\langle | \frac{\Delta p_{n}}{\Delta t}| \rangle=\sqrt{\frac{1}{2 \cdot \pi \cdot \sigma_{n}^{2}}} \cdot \sigma_{\dot{P}(n)} \tag{9}
\end{equation*}
$$

More work is required for the transactions cost. We use a transactions cost function of the form:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{tc}\left(\Delta p_{n}\right)=c_{1, n} \cdot\left|\Delta p_{n}\right|+c_{2, n} \cdot\left|\Delta p_{n}\right|^{\phi}, \tag{10}
\end{equation*}
$$
where the second term is for market impact. The parameter $\phi$ typically equals 1.5 or 2 .

\footnotetext{
5. The normality assumption is the simplest case. All that is really required is that the new information, Equation (2), has mean zero, standard deviation 1, and a symmetric distribution. Then we could follow that through the analysis and easily estimate the expectations of the absolute value to any power.
}

The expected annual transactions cost is then:
$$
\begin{align*}
& c_{P(n)} \equiv E\left\langle\frac{t c(\Delta p)}{\Delta t}\right\rangle=k_{1, n} \cdot \sigma_{\dot{P}(n)}+k_{2, n} \cdot \sigma_{\dot{P}(n)}^{\phi} \\
& \text { where } \left.k_{1, n}=\frac{c_{1, n}}{\sigma_{n}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}, \quad k_{2, n}=\left.\frac{c_{2, n} \cdot \Delta t^{\phi-1}}{\sigma_{n}^{\phi}} \cdot E\langle | Z\right|^{\phi}\right\rangle \tag{11}
\end{align*}
$$

If $\phi=1.5$ and the distribution is normal, then $\left.\left.E\langle | Z\right|^{1.5}\right\rangle=0.86$. If $\phi=2$, then $\left.\left.E\langle | Z\right|^{2}\right\rangle=1.00$.

\section*{Sensitivity and Maximization}

Given a trading rate, $d_{n}$, and a linear trading rule, we can predict, with reasonable accuracy, the evolution of the portfolio at both the asset and aggregate level. Exhibits 3, 4, and 5 show how key investment parameters vary as we change the trading rate. In these sensitivity tests, the zero-cost weight, $\mathbf{w}_{Q(n)}$, remains fixed. However, as we change that trading rate, the target weight, $\mathbf{w}_{M(n)}$, and resulting position weight, $\mathbf{w}_{P(n)}$, will change in the manner of Equations (6) through (8). For the sensitivity analysis, we clustered the assets into five buckets according to market impact and used volatility and transactions cost data that were representative of the assets in each bucket. Typical results are shown in Exhibits 3 and 4.

Exhibit 3 shows how the expected alpha, cost, and risk change for a typical asset as a function the trade rate $d$. Of interest are the two bottom curves. Note that the costs accelerate and swamp alpha when the trade rate hits about 7.

EXHIBIT 3 Alpha, Risk, and T-Cost Contribution
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_02_02_fd8e8ff53ac17a7c4202g-225.jpg?height=785&width=1136&top_left_y=440&top_left_x=179)

Exhibit 4 illustrates the link between the trade rate $d$ and the effective allocation of risk, $\mathbf{w}_{P(n)}$, to the three signals in our example. For the trade rate below 5 , the SLOW signal is getting more weight. After that, the intermediate horizon signal INT predominates. The weight assigned to the FAST signal increases at an increasing rate over the interval $0<d<10$. This explains the accelerating costs in Exhibit 3.

The objective is annual alpha minus annual cost and minus a penalty for variance:
$$
\begin{align*}
& \mathrm{O}_{n} \equiv\left\{\alpha_{P(n)}-c_{P(n)}\right\}-\frac{\lambda}{2} \cdot \sigma_{P(n)}^{2} \\
& \mathrm{O}_{P} \equiv \sum_{n=1: N} \mathrm{O}_{n}=\left\{\alpha_{P}-c_{P}\right\}-\frac{\lambda}{2} \cdot \sigma_{P}^{2}  \tag{12}\\
& \alpha_{P}=\sum_{n=1: N} \alpha_{P(n)}, \quad c_{P}=\sum_{n=1: N} c_{P(n)}, \quad \sigma_{P}^{2}=\sum_{n=1: N} \sigma_{P(n)}^{2}
\end{align*}
$$

The individual contributions sum to the aggregate through the assumption of either independent specific returns or uncorrelated signals across assets.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_02_02_fd8e8ff53ac17a7c4202g-226.jpg?height=779&width=1144&top_left_y=157&top_left_x=177)

Exhibit 5 looks at the contribution of a representative asset to the objective. In this case it peaks at a trade rate of 2.4. The sensitivity analysis suggests that we use the analytical results to select a trade rate that maximizes expected asset contribution to the overall objective $O_{P}$.

Exhibit 6 shows the distribution of the maximizing trade rates for the 200 assets in our sample of Australian data. The average trade rate is 2.68 and they have a standard deviation of 1.25 . Only 6 of the 200 assets have a trade rate less than 1, and another 6 have trade rates 5 or more. The resulting trading rates are a major improvement compared to a naive alternative of the same trade rate (2.68) for each asset. The bulk of the improvement comes in savings on transactions cost.

\section*{Position Paths}

Once we have set the trade rates, we can describe position paths. Starting with an initial position, $p_{n}(-\Delta t)$, for an asset and the current source positions, $b_{n, j}(0)$, we can use the linear trading rule to plot a series of positions that, in the absence of new information, we should follow in the next few periods.

The equations for the expected position and target in $\tau$ periods are:
$$
\begin{align*}
& \hat{s}_{n, j}(t)=e^{-g_{j} \cdot t} \cdot s_{n, j}(0) \\
& \hat{m}_{n}(t)=\sum_{j=1: J} \hat{s}_{n, j}(t) \cdot w_{M(n), j}  \tag{13}\\
& \hat{p}_{n}(t)=\delta_{n} \cdot \hat{p}_{n}(t-\Delta t)+\left(1-\delta_{n}\right) \cdot \hat{m}_{n}(t)
\end{align*}
$$

EXHIBIT 6 AUS Objective Maximizing Trade Rates

Exhibit 7 shows three position paths depending on different initial conditions. The initial position is zero in all cases. In each of the scenarios the SLOW signal is strong, a two standard deviation event: $s_{n, \text { SLOW }}(0)=2$. The intermediate signal INT is negative, a minus one standard deviation event: $s_{n, I N T}(0)=-1$. The scenarios differ in the FAST signal. In the first scenario, it is extremely positive: $s_{n, F A S T}(0)=2$, a two standard deviation event. In the middle scenario, it is zero: $s_{n, F A S T}(0)=0$, there is no short-term information. In the third scenario, the FAST signal is a minus two standard deviation event: $s_{n, F A S T}(0)=-2$. When the FAST signal is reinforcing the SLOW signal, we immediately start to build up a position. However, when the FAST signal is strongly negative, we sell for a few periods and then start to build up the position.

The simulation produces signals, sources, positions, alphas, and target positions for 200 stocks and 2,520 dates. We obtained specific volatility and transactions cost data for a sample of Australian stocks. The trading rates differ from asset to asset. They were selected using the maximization process described above. The risk aversion was set at $\lambda=25$. The time interval was a trading day; $1 / 252$ of a year. The information ratio and half-life data are the same as Exhibit 1.

In our first pass we chose to have a small correlation among the signals for any asset. The correlations are in Exhibit 8.

EXHIBIT 8 Correlation Among the Signals
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ SIGNAL CORR. $\mathbf{R}$} & FAST & INT. & SLOW \\
\hline FAST & 1 & -0.0280 & 0.0043 \\
\hline INT. & -0.0280 & 1 & 0.0340 \\
\hline SLOW & 0.0043 & 0.0340 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

This is a lab test. It is not a backtest. No returns are involved. We want to check that predicted levels of turnover, transactions cost, risk, and exposure to sources of alpha agree with the predictions.

In the course of the simulation we gathered data on alpha, risk, cost, and turnover. We also scored the assets on their contribution to the overall objective, Equation (12).

In addition, we calculated the information ratio and the after-cost information ratio, ACIR:
$$
\begin{align*}
& I R_{P}=\frac{\sum_{n=1: N} \alpha_{P(n)}}{\sqrt{\sum_{n=1: N} \sigma_{P(n)}^{2}}}=\frac{\alpha_{P}}{\sigma_{P}} \\
& A C I R_{P} \equiv \frac{\sum_{n=1: N}\left\{\alpha_{P(n)}-c_{P(n)}\right\}}{\sqrt{\sum_{n=1: N} \sigma_{P(n)}^{2}}}=\frac{\alpha_{P}-c_{P}}{\sigma_{P}} \tag{14}
\end{align*}
$$

Finally, we calculated the correlation with the target:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\rho_{P, M}=\frac{\sum_{n=1 / N} \sigma_{P(n), M(n)}}{\sqrt{\sum_{n=1} \sigma_{P(n)}^{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\sum_{n=1: N} \sigma_{M(n)}^{2}}} \approx \frac{\sum_{n=1: N} \sigma_{P(n)}^{2}}{\sqrt{\sum_{n=1} \sigma_{P(n)}^{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\sum_{n=1: N} \sigma_{M(n)}^{2}}}=\frac{\sigma_{P}}{\sigma_{M}} \tag{15}
\end{equation*}
$$

The approximation above flows from $\sigma_{P(n), M(n)} \approx \sigma_{P(n)}^{2}$.
Most of the simulation results are sample averages. For example, asset $n$ 's contribution to portfolio alpha in the sample is:
$$
\begin{align*}
& \frac{1}{T} \cdot \sum_{t=1: T} \alpha_{n}(t) \cdot p_{n}(t) \text { the simulation result }  \tag{16}\\
& \alpha_{P(n)}=\lambda \cdot \sigma_{n}^{2} \cdot \mathbf{w}_{\mathcal{Q}(n)}^{\prime} \cdot \mathbf{R}_{n} \cdot \mathbf{w}_{P(n)} \text { the predicted result }
\end{align*}
$$

Equation (8) provides a prediction exposure of each asset to each signal. To measure the simulated position risk weights for asset $n$, we ran a time-series regression:
$$
\begin{equation*}
p_{n}(t)=\hat{a}_{0, n}+\sum_{j=1: J} s_{n, j}(t) \cdot \hat{w}_{n, j}+e r r_{n}(t) \tag{17}
\end{equation*}
$$
$\hat{w}_{n, j}$ is the estimated weight of asset $n$ on signal $j$
The aggregate, portfolio level, results of the simulation presented in Exhibit 9 are excellent:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ ITEM } & PREDICTION & SIMULATION \\
\hline Alpha & 7.14 & 6.96 \\
\hline T-Cost/yr. & 1.97 & 1.99 \\
\hline Risk & 4.02 & 3.94 \\
\hline Objective & 3.16 & 3.04 \\

\hline correlation(P,M) & 0.76 & 0.75 \\
\hline Target Risk & 5.34 & 5.34 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Results at the asset level are, of course, less accurate. We evaluated asset level predictions using:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{Sim}_{n}=a_{0}+a_{1} \cdot \operatorname{Predict}_{n}+\operatorname{err}_{n} \text { for } n=1: N, \tag{18}
\end{equation*}
$$
where $\operatorname{Sim}_{n}$ is the simulated result for asset $n$ and $\operatorname{Predict}_{n}$ is the predicted result for asset $n$. We want the coefficient $a_{1}$ to be close to one and the $R^{2}$ to be large.

Exhibit 10 shows the scatter diagram and regression result for transactions cost. Exhibit 11 shows the same scatter diagram and regression result for alpha contribution. The scatter diagram contains the predicted, that is, expected, value on the horizontal axis and the simulated value on the vertical. The transactions cost is the most accurate of the alpha, cost, and risk trio and the alphas are the least accurate. The dashed line is the theoretical ideal with a slope of one and an intercept that adjusts for the simulated average being unequal to the predicted average. The dotted line is the OLS regression line.

Exhibit 12 shows the results of the regression in Equation (18) for nine important properties of the simulation. At the asset level, the items that involve changes in position (transactions cost, turnover, and $\sigma_{\dot{P}(n)}$ ) are captured extremely well.

For the other items, two effects make the estimation difficult: the relatively long half-life of some signals allows random departures from the expected to persist for extended periods, and exposure to the FAST signal is small, and tends to get lost in the noise.

EXHIBIT 12 Link Between Expectation and Simulated Averages
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ VARIABLE } & SLOPE & R2 \\
\hline Alpha $P(n)$ & 0.94 & 0.36 \\
\hline Risk Position $P(n)$ & 1.00 & 0.60 \\
\hline T-Cost/yr. & 0.99 & 0.89 \\
\hline Risk P-dot $(n)$ & 0.99 & 0.98 \\
\hline Risk Target $M(n)$ & 0.98 & 0.69 \\
\hline Cov $\{M(n), P(n)\}$ & 0.99 & 0.55 \\
\hline Omega $P(n$, FAST $)$ & 0.86 & 0.30 \\
\hline Omega $P(n$, INT. $)$ & 0.99 & 0.76 \\
\hline Omega $P(n$, SLOW $)$ & 0.95 & 0.54 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

We ranked the assets by objective value, $O_{n}$, using both the expected values and the outcome of the simulation to construct two Gini curves. Exhibit 13 shows the results.

The value added is not evenly distributed; low $t$-cost assets have an advantage. On the predicted curve, we have about half of the value added from one-third of the assets. All of the assets are expected to add value. In the Gini curve summarizing the simulation, we find half of the value added with about $22 \%$ of the assets, and the last $10 \%$ or so of the assets lose value on a cost and risk adjusted basis over the 10 years of the simulation.

\section*{Signal Correlation}

The results above are for a case with little correlation between the signals. To test whether this was crucial, we did a second simulation where the FAST signal was, by design, uncorrelated with the others and the correlation of the innovations of the INT and SLOW signals was 0.4 . This leads to signal correlation of 0.346 . Exhibit 14 shows the results.

\hline T-Cost/yr & 1.60 & 1.59 \\
\hline Portfolio Risk & 3.24 & 3.26 \\
\hline Objective & 2.00 & 2.02 \\
\hline ACIR & 1.02 & 1.03 \\
\hline Corr(P,M) & 0.735 & 0.738 \\
\hline Target Risk & 4.32 & 4.43 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The net result was an overall lowering of the potential information ratio due to redundant information. The predictions are just as accurate.

\section*{USA Test}

We ran a second simulation using specific risk and transactions cost data on a far larger sample of 3,136 US stocks. The results did not differ much although the average optimal trade rate was lower in the United States, 1.68,
compared to 2.68 in Australia. This is understandable, since the Australian sample was the 200 largest stocks and the USA sample includes several thousand illiquid stocks. Exhibit 15 presents a histogram of the optimal trading rates in the USA sample. The USA simulation used the same time period (1/252), risk aversion (25), period (10 years), half-lives, and assumed information ratios. The samples differed in number of assets, trade rates, asset specific risk, and transactions cost data.

The aggregate results for the United States have no surprises, as Exhibit 16 shows.

EXHIBIT 16 USA: Aggregate Simulation Results.
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ ITEM } & PREDICTION & SIMULATION \\
\hline Alpha & 4.57 & 4.44 \\
\hline T-Cost/yr. & 2.10 & 2.11 \\
\hline Portfolio Risk & 3.06 & 2.97 \\
\hline Objective & 1.30 & 1.23 \\
\hline ACIR & 0.81 & 0.78 \\
\hline Corr(P,M) & 0.72 & 0.72 \\
\hline Target Risk & 4.27 & 4.27 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

There isn't much difference at the aggregate level, with the law of large numbers playing an important role. The relatively high transactions costs have an intimidating effect. There is a larger opportunity loss in this US example.

For comparison with the Australian case we have included the assetspecific regression results. Compare Exhibit 17 and Exhibit 10 on transactions costs, and also Exhibits 18 and 11 on alpha.

The regression results for all the variables are included in Exhibit 19 (compare with Exhibit 12 for Australia).

EXHIBIT 19 USA: Link Between Expectation and Simulated Averages
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ VARIABLE } & SLOPE & R2 \\
\hline Alpha $\{P(n)\}$ & 0.99 & 0.47 \\
\hline Risk $\{P(n)\}$ & 1.00 & 0.72 \\
\hline $\operatorname{Cost}\{P(n)\} /$ yr. & 1.01 & 0.93 \\
\hline Risk $P$-dot $(n)$ & 1.01 & 0.98 \\
\hline Target Risk $\{M(n)\}$ & 1.00 & 0.81 \\
\hline $\operatorname{Cov}\{M(n), P(n)\}$ & 1.00 & 0.60 \\

\hline Omega $P(n$, INT. $)$ & 0.90 & 0.76 \\
\hline Omega $P(n$, SLOW $)$ & 0.93 & 0.66 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Exhibit 19 shows a similar pattern as the Australian sample. It is easy to predict the effect of changes and hard to get a handle on the FAST signal.

EXHIBIT 20 USA: Expected and the Simulated Objective Value

The Gini results, shown in Exhibit 20, are more pronounced than the Australian case. On the predicted curve we have about half of the value added from $30 \%$ of the assets and all of the assets are expected to add some value. In the Gini curve summarizing the simulation we get half of the value added with about $10 \%$ of the assets, and the last $33 \%$ or so of the assets lose value on a cost and risk adjusted basis over the 10 years of the simulation.

\section*{Implementation}

We can predict the behavior of a system governed by a linear trading rule and use those predictions to choose the trading rate parameter, $d_{n}$, for each asset in order to maximize that asset's contribution to an overall objective. To move toward implementation, we must tackle several aspects of the portfolio management problem we have ignored thus far.
- The position $p_{n}(t)$ is an active position, the deviation between our holding in an asset and the holding of some benchmark or index. There may be constraints on the size of the active positions, requiring the net active position to be zero, long-only constraints requiring
the active plus benchmark position to be nonnegative, or constraints associated with a 120-20 portfolio. ${ }^{6}$
- The portfolio may also be taking active factor/smart beta positions in addition to the alphas based on specific return.
- The linear trading rule leads to a large number of small trades, although it is commonly accepted that transactions costs of the type we posited in Equation (10) lead to a no-trade zone for each asset; that is, at each time and for each asset there will be a lower and upper limit such that you sell if your position is above the upper limit and buy if you are below the lower limit and you do not trade if you are between the limits, see Grinold (2018) (Chapter 11, "Nonlinear Trading Rules" in this book). In contrast, the linear trading rule trades all the time.
- The linear trading rule provides average risk control rather than period to period risk control. The active risk of the portfolio tends to drift, and there is nothing to prevent serendipity having signals that favor the preponderance of financial stocks in one period or disliking most of the stocks in extractive industries in another. On average risk control is unsatisfactory.

Traditional single or multistage optimization handles the matters detailed above with relative ease despite a case of shortsightedness. Therefore, our proposal is to take the long-range objective of dynamic programming and harness it to the calculating engine that I refer to as traditional portfolio optimization.

\subsection*{Nonlinear Trading Rules}

In the introduction to the "Dynamic Portfolio Analysis" section of this book, we discussed implementation in the more general context of nonlinear trading rules, in particular nonlinear trading rules for general transactions costs, Equation (10). ${ }^{7}$ If the nonlinear market impact term in the transactions cost has coefficient $\phi=1.5$, then we use a nonlinear trading rule called NLTR1.5. If the coefficient is $\phi=2$, then we use NLTR2. The introduction to this section of the book (Chapter 6) uses NLTR1.5 as an example, so we will use NLTR2 here. We suggest an objective with two components. The first component is derived from the nonlinear trading rule:

Component I:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\lambda}{2} \cdot \sum_{n=1: N} \sigma_{n}^{2} \cdot\left\{\left(b_{n}-\Delta p_{n}\right)^{2}+z_{n} \cdot\left|\Delta p_{n}\right|+\frac{k_{n}}{2} \cdot\left|\Delta p_{n}\right|^{2}\right\} \tag{19}
\end{equation*}
$$
where
$b_{n}=m_{n}-p_{n}$ is the backlog: target-initial position
$z_{n}, k_{n}$ are the maximizing parameters

\footnotetext{
6. See Jacobs and Levy (2007).
7. We will cover this topic in more detail in Chapter 11, "Nonlinear Trading Rules for Portfolio Management."
}

The nonnegative parameters $z_{n}$ and $k_{n}$ are selected for asset $n$ in order to maximize its contribution to the overall objective. The nonlinear trading rule article describes the optimization methodology.

We invite the reader to examine the case where the backlog is positive, that is, we are thinking of buying. The question is: how much, if any, do we buy? The answer is nothing if $0 \leq b_{n} \leq z_{n}$. If $z_{n}<b_{n}$, then we buy $\Delta p_{n}=\left(b_{n}-z_{n}\right) /\left(1+k_{n}\right)$. Note that $z_{n}=0$ and $k_{n}=\delta_{n} /\left(1-\delta_{n}\right)$ will provide the same trades as the linear trading rule.

If component I is the only term in the objective (and we are minimizing), then we will execute the optimal trading rule for each asset. However, there may be concerns pushing the portfolio in other directions.

In particular there is the question of controlling common factor risk and making smart beta/factor forecasts. A discussion requires some additional notation.
$\mathbf{X}$ an $N$ by $K$ matrix of factor exposures
$\mathbf{x}_{T}$ a $K$ element vector of desired active exposures
$\mathbf{F}$ a $K$ by $K$ matrix, covariance plus penalties
$\mathbf{p}=\left\{p_{n}\right\}_{n=1: N}$ is the vector of active positions
$\mathbf{x}_{P}=\mathbf{X}^{\prime} \cdot \mathbf{p}$ a $K$ element vector of active exposures

With this notation the component II is:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\eta}{2} \cdot\left(\mathbf{x}_{T}-\mathbf{x}_{P}\right)^{\prime} \cdot \mathbf{F} \cdot\left(\mathbf{x}_{T}-\mathbf{x}_{P}\right) \tag{21}
\end{equation*}
$$

Two points are in order:
- An alternative or supplement to the common factor penalty, Equation (21), is the use of upper and lower bounds on the deviation, $\mathbf{x}_{T}-\mathbf{x}_{P}$. This is, in this author's opinion, a second-best solution. Bounds of this sort should be a safety warning mechanism like a circuit breaker or a guardrail. Hitting the constraint sets off an alarm and indicates that something is out of whack.
- If some desired factor exposures are drifting around too much, say factor $k$, then consider adding a penalty by increasing the diagonal element, $F_{k, k}$, to tighten things up. In this way we can interpret the parameter $\eta$ in Equation (21) as a way to tighten and loosen all the penalties and increasing the diagonal elements to tighten up a specific penalty. ${ }^{8}$

This suggested approach is based on theory and experience. It has not been tested. In the least likely case, it may work splendidly the first time it's tried. Otherwise, it may be a dead end, or it may need considerable tweaking before it works. Any test should start as simply as possible, and not add any elaboration until the simpler problem has been thoroughly understood.

\footnotetext{
8. The penalty, Equation (21), is a convex function. Increasing a diagonal element does not endanger its convex status, but decreasing a diagonal element does.
}

\section*{Summary}

Under special circumstances, described in Appendix B, the optimal investment policy for each asset is a linear trading rule that moves from the current position to a new position between the current position and a target. The linear trading rule is our gateway to dynamic portfolio management. We want to know how a linear trading rule can help us manage a portfolio.

We first defined linear trading rules and demonstrated how they predict useful aspects of asset and portfolio behavior. These include risk, transactions cost, turnover, and exposure to various sources of alpha. The predictions are precise at the portfolio level, and the transactions cost and turnover predictions are accurate at the asset level.

Once we have confidence in the predictions, it is a small step to choosing the rate of trading for each asset in order to maximize its contribution to an overall objective. That choice of an optimal trading rate is based on the information ratios of the signals, a penalty on variance, any correlation among the signals, the half-lives of the signals, and the specific volatility and transactions cost of the asset.

A by-product of selecting a trading rate is transactions cost-dependent signal weighting at the asset level. The choice of a trading weight determines the signal weighting for the asset's target ( $\mathbf{w}_{M(n)}$ in the text) and a prediction of the resulting exposure of the asset to the signals ( $\mathbf{w}_{P(n)}$ in the text).

The information gained in this exercise can be used to replace the objective of a static (one or multistage) portfolio optimization with an objective that will lead us to execute the trading rule if other considerations such as constraints, bounds, desired factor exposures, etc. do not get in the way.

A by-product of this study is a process for transaction cost sensitive signal weighting at the asset level. This opens the door for research that is tailored to a particular segment of the market or in an extreme case to a particular asset.

In Chapter 11, "Nonlinear Trading Rules for Portfolio Management," we carry these ideas forward. In the fifteen months since this article was published we have been able to generalize the results significantly. We can dispense with the requirement that the returns we are forecasting are uncorrelated. We can also allow for signals that effect several assets. For example a WIN-WIN signal that is good (or bad) news for more than one firm; e.g., a b to c firm and its suppliers. We can also allow for WIN-LOSE signals where what portends good news for one company is bad news for its rivals. The calculations become more difficult but the general results hold. There is an optimal linear trade rate for each asset that we can calculate and we can predict the alpha, risk, and cost of the resulting portfolio using those linear trade rates.

Above all we hope that the reader will understand that a portfolio is in motion, it is a dynamic object, and a perceptive portfolio manager will realize where it wants to go, for what benefit, at what cost, and when it might get there.
