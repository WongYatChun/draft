\section*{1. Introduction}

The active long-short investment strategy described here is the simplest system based on three principles:
- Old information becomes stale.
- New information arrives.
- Trading occurs to close the gap between what we hold and what we would like to hold.

There are two parameters. One measures the rate of change of the information driving the strategy, and the other controls the speed of trading in the portfolio. The system can be used in both a descriptive and a normative manner. In the descriptive application, we observe an investment strategy and estimate the values of the parameters. This will let us reconcile our prior views with the estimated values; in other words, we may think we are doing X , but the data suggest that Y is more likely.

The normative application works at two levels. At the strategic level, we evaluate choices that differ according to the speed of the information flow driving the strategy and the perceived strength of the information. At more of a tactical level, given the speed of information flow, its perceived strength, and the level of costs, we can choose the rate of trading in an optimal manner.

This is called dynamic portfolio analysis. It works at the aggregate levelâ€”lots of forest, no trees. We are not trying to capture the detailed nature of the investment strategy, but rather its most salient characteristics. To that end, I do not shy away from simplifying assumptions. Some of these are more open to challenge than the rest, but the true test of them all is the ability of the resulting theory to deliver on its promises. I hope to present a portrait that captures the essence, omits the details, and reveals a constructive perspective.

The section breakdown is as follows. In section 2 of this chapter we introduce two portfolios and the laws of motion (difference equations) that govern their evolution. The first portfolio is called "the model." We would trade to the model if we were given a holiday on transactions costs. The second portfolio is called "the portfolio"; it is the positions we actually hold. The first difference equation describes the information flow via changes in the model. The second difference equation shows how we adjust the portfolio to make it more like the model.

In section 3 we view the strategy from a "stock and flow" perspective. Stock in this case does not mean equity; it refers to the expected absolute size of all positions in the portfolio. Flow is the annual round trip turnover in the portfolio. The relationship between stock and flow is governed by the two parameters that describe the model and the portfolio's laws of motion.

Section 4 shows how our simple structure allows us to characterize the potential efficiency of the strategy in several ways. These include the transfer coefficient and the expected age (vintage) of the information in our portfolio. In addition, we see how the notions of breadth and the transfer coefficient relate to the age of the information in the portfolio.

In section 5 we discuss how we can (roughly) choose an optimal rate of trading to strike an appropriate balance between tracking a model portfolio and trading costs. We provide analytic expressions for the most important characteristics when we are following such a policy.

In section 6 we apply these ideas to a strategy. We estimate the values of the two parameters and use those values and the previously developed theory to explain and predict the portfolio's behavior. Section 7 is a summary. Technical matters are relegated to the appendices to this chapter that serve this article and Chapter 7, "Implementation Efficiency."

\section*{2. The Laws of Motion}

There are $N$ assets. Time is discrete. We rebalance the portfolio at regular intervals of length $\Delta t$ years. Think of $\Delta t$ as a month $(1 / 12)$, a week $(1 / 52)$, or a trading day (1/252). The investment strategy is long-short with no constraints. We are concerned with two portfolios. The first is a model, $M$, with holdings $\mathbf{m}(t)$ at time t . It is also known as "the model," or the "target," or simply $M$. Portfolio $M$ is a portfolio whose holdings have a maximum information ratio. The second is the portfolio we hold (aka "the portfolio" or $P$ ), the vector $\mathbf{p}(t)$ contains our positions in the $N$ assets at time $t$. In a world
free of transactions cost we would have $\mathbf{p}(t)=\mathbf{m}(t)$; things would be wonderful and less interesting.

\subsection*{Changes in the Model ( $M$ )}

The change in $M, \Delta \mathrm{~m}(t) \equiv \mathrm{m}(t)-\mathrm{m}(t-\Delta t)$, arises from the arrival of new information and the fading of old information. The equation is:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta \mathbf{m}(t)=-g \cdot \mathbf{m}(t-\Delta t) \cdot \Delta t+\mathbf{u}(t) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

The erosion of old information is captured by the term $g \cdot \mathbf{m}(t-\Delta t) \cdot \Delta t$; this is the anticipated change in $M$. The new information is represented by $\mathbf{u}(t)$, that embodies the unanticipated changes in $M$. In equilibrium new information flows in at roughly the same rate that it is flowing out. Let $\omega_{M}^{2}$ and $\omega_{U}^{2}$ be respectively the expected variance ${ }^{2}$ of $M$ and the positions implied by the new information. For the system to be in equilibrium we must have:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\omega_{U}^{2}=2 \cdot g \cdot \omega_{M}^{2} \cdot \Delta t . \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

\subsection*{The Parameter $g$}

The parameter $g$ plays a leading role in what follows. The parameter $g$ is an annual rate of information loss with $g \cdot \Delta t$ being the expected information loss over one rebalance cycle. We can characterize $g$ in other ways. In section 4 we show that $1 / g$ is the average age of the information in the model. We anticipate that the size of any model position will gradually shrink to zero. Let $H L$ be the amount of time until the expected model position is onehalf its current size. $H L$ is the half-life of the information and is related to $g$ and the average age of information in the model through $H L=\ln (2) / g$. Since $\ln (2)=0.693$, the half-life is about $70 \%$ of the average age. The term $\gamma=e^{-g \cdot \Delta t}$ is the correlation of $\mathbf{m}(t)$ with $\mathbf{m}(t-\Delta t)$. Exhibit 1 shows various values of $g$, the corresponding half-lives (in years), the autocorrelation $\gamma$ (gamma), the fraction of information we lose, $g \cdot \Delta t$ over a daily trading cycle (i.e., $\Delta t=1 / 252$ ), and $1 / g$, the average age (in years) of the information.

EXHIBIT 1 The Parameter g, Half-Life (in Years), Autocorrelation Gamma, \% Loss of Information, and Average Age
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline $\mathbf{g}$ & HALF-LIFE & $\gamma$ & \% LOSS & AVE. AGE \\
\hline 8.00 & 0.087 & 0.969 & $3.17 \%$ & 0.13 \\
\hline 6.00 & 0.116 & 0.976 & $2.38 \%$ & 0.17 \\
\hline 4.00 & 0.173 & 0.984 & $1.59 \%$ & 0.25 \\
\hline 2.00 & 0.347 & 0.992 & $0.79 \%$ & 0.5 \\
\hline 1.00 & 0.693 & 0.996 & $0.40 \%$ & 1.00 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

All based on a daily trading cycle, $\Delta t=1 / 252$.
2. At time $t$ with covariance matrix $\mathbf{V}(t)$ the variance is $\omega_{M}^{2}(t)=\mathbf{m}^{\prime}(t) \cdot \mathbf{V}(t) \cdot \mathbf{m}(t)$. The expected variance is $\omega_{M}^{2}=E\left\langle\omega_{M}^{2}(t)\right\rangle$. In the same way $\omega_{U}^{2}=E\left\langle\mathbf{u}^{\prime}(t) \cdot \mathbf{V}(t) \cdot \mathbf{u}(t)\right\rangle$.

The parameter $g$ is also related to the concept of breadth in the fundamental law of active management (Grinold 1989). That law says that the potential information ratio, $I R$, of a strategy is equal to the product of forecasting skill (as measured by the correlation of the forecasts with outcomes aka the information coefficient or $I C$ ) times the square root of the number of independent forecasts per year (the breadth or $B R$ ). In algebraic terms, $I R=I C \cdot \sqrt{B R}$. A reasonable estimate ${ }^{3}$ for breadth in an $N$ asset strategy is:
$$
\begin{equation*}
B R=g \cdot N \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
$$

The potential $I R$ is achieved by $M$ so we have for any portfolio $P$ :
$$
\begin{equation*}
I R=I R_{M}=I C \cdot \sqrt{g \cdot N} \geq I R_{p} \tag{4}
\end{equation*}
$$

\subsection*{Trading Policy, the Change in $P$}

The change in $P, \Delta \mathbf{p}(t) \equiv \mathbf{p}(t)-\mathbf{p}(t-\Delta t)$, is the amount we trade. ${ }^{4}$ The trade is linked to $M$ by a second difference equation:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta \mathbf{p}(t)=d \cdot\{\mathbf{m}(t)-\mathbf{p}(t-\Delta t)\} \cdot \Delta t \tag{5}
\end{equation*}
$$

Unlike Equation (1), there is no uncertainty in Equation (5). We know the pretrade portfolio, $\mathbf{p}(t-\Delta t)$, and the model, $\mathbf{m}(t)$, so the trade size is specified. The uncertainty enters indirectly through Equation (1). Also note that there is no trade if our pretrade portfolio is in the right spot, when $\mathbf{p}(t-\Delta t)=\mathbf{m}(t)$.

\subsection*{The Parameter d}

The gap between $M$ and $P$ is called the backlog. We close the backlog at an annual rate of $d$ with $d \cdot \Delta t$ being the fraction of the gap closed in any one period. In equilibrium the gap between $M$ and $P$ will stay roughly constant, see Equation (14) below. In section 5 we see that an optimal value of $d$ is linked to trading costs; higher costs call for slower trading and thus a smaller value of $d$.

As with $g, 1 / d$ is an interval of time. It is (see Equation (19)) the age gap between portfolios $P$ and $M$.

We will have occasion to refer to $\delta \equiv e^{-d \cdot \Delta t}$. The term $\delta$ is not the autocorrelation of the portfolio. The term $1-\delta \approx d \cdot \Delta t$ is the fraction of holdings that change in any one rebalance.

\footnotetext{
3. Suppose that in the period $\Delta t$ we get new information (a complete change) for $K$ of the assets and absolutely no change for the remaining $N-K$ assets. Since there are $1 / \Delta t$ periods per year, this implies a breadth of $K / \Delta t$. If we regress $\mathrm{m}(t)$ against $\mathrm{m}(t-\Delta t)$ we get a coefficient $\gamma=\{N-K\} / N$. Thus $K / N=1-\gamma \approx g \cdot \Delta t$, or $g \cdot N \approx K / \Delta t$. This is covered in more depth in Chapter 5.
4. We are ignoring changes in relative position size due to price movement. This tends to be a second-order effect.
}

\subsection*{The Rebalance Interval}

The rebalance interval or trade cycle, $\Delta t$, should be selected contingent on the values of $g$ and $d$. If information is flowing rapidly, large $g$, then $\Delta t$ should be small. If we are trading quickly, large $d$, then $\Delta t$ should be small. A good rule of thumb is that $\Delta t$ should be small enough so that the approximations $(1-\gamma)=\left(1-e^{-g \cdot \Delta t}\right) \approx g \cdot \Delta t$ and $(1-\delta)=\left(1-e^{-d \cdot \Delta t}\right) \approx d \cdot \Delta t$ are very close. ${ }^{5}$ For the remainder of the paper we will treat these approximations as if they were exact and consider the laws of motion, Equation (6), as equivalent to Equations (1) and (5):
$$
\begin{align*}
& \mathbf{m}(t)=\gamma \cdot \mathbf{m}(t-\Delta t)+\mathbf{u}(t) \\
& \mathbf{p}(t)=\delta \cdot \mathbf{p}(t-\Delta t)+(1-\delta) \cdot \mathbf{m}(t) \tag{6}
\end{align*}
$$

\footnotetext{
5. Another criterion for the choice of the trade interval is making $\Delta t$ sufficiently large so that any liquidity imbalance caused by a trade made at time $t-\Delta t$ will be resolved by time $t$.
}

\section*{3. Stock and Flow}

These results are derived in Appendix B to this chapter.

\subsection*{Stock}

The stock is the expected total of the long positions and the short positions. ${ }^{6}$ If we let $\tilde{p}_{n}(t)$ be the uncertain position in asset $n$ at time $t$ then stock is:
$$
\begin{equation*}
S \equiv E\left\langle\sum_{n=1, N}\right| \tilde{p}_{n}(t)| \rangle . \tag{7}
\end{equation*}
$$

Under special circumstances that are detailed in Appendix B, we can obtain a closed form expression for $S$. This result, Equation (8) below, is not interesting for the purposes of inference; $S$ is eminently observable. Equation (8) is notable because it reveals the drivers of the value of $S$. If there are $N$ assets, the strategy's risk is $\omega_{P}$ and the average risk ${ }^{7}$ of the assets is $\bar{\sigma}$ then:
$$
\begin{equation*}
S=\sqrt{N} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \cdot \frac{\omega_{P}}{\bar{\sigma}} . \tag{8}
\end{equation*}
$$

Higher strategy risk, $\omega_{P}$, means larger active positions. If the assets are riskier, more $\bar{\sigma}$, then we can get by with smaller positions and still produce the same risk, $\omega_{P}$, at the strategy level. As we add more assets, we add more positions. However, these positions are generally smaller because we get the benefit of diversification. The netting of those two effects, more and smaller positions, gives us the result that the total increases as the square root of the number of assets. Thus if we went from 400 assets to 900 assets all with the same average risk, $\bar{\sigma}$, and strategy risk, $\omega_{p}$, then we could expected that the size of the absolute positions, $S$, would increase by $50 \%$. The $\sqrt{2 / \pi} \approx 0.8$ arises because the expected absolute value of a standard normal random variable is $\sqrt{2 / \pi}$.

\footnotetext{
6. The stock is also the expected leverage or gearing of the portfolio. Some people define those quantities by convention as $50 \%$ of the stock.
7. $\bar{\sigma}$ is the harmonic average. If asset $n$ has risk $\sigma_{n}$ then $1 / \bar{\sigma} \equiv\{1 / N\} \cdot \sum_{n=1, N}\left\{1 / \sigma_{n}\right\}$.
}

\subsection*{Flow}

The flow is the expected annual round trip turnover. When the strategy is governed in the fashion of the two difference Equations (1) and (5) then the formula (in fact a rough estimate) for the flow is:
$$
\begin{equation*}
F=S \cdot \sqrt{g \cdot d}, \text { or } S=F \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{g \cdot d}} \tag{9}
\end{equation*}
$$

The intuition appears to be correct. Faster moving information, large $g$, and faster trading, large $d$, will add to the flow. Recall that $1 / g$ and $1 / d$; are measured in years. The square root $1 / \sqrt{g \cdot d}$ is the harmonic mean of these two times, also measured in years. We can think of the investment process as setting up $F$ new positions per year each of them expected to last an amount of time $1 / \sqrt{g \cdot d}$.

\section*{4. Model and Portfolio Characteristics}

This section takes the laws of motion and links them to characteristics of $M$ and $P$. There are three subsections:
- Implementation efficiency deals with the $P$ 's ability to capture $M$ 's information.
- Age distribution considers the exposure of $M$ and $P$ to information of different ages. That analysis offers a different slant on the notions of breadth and the transfer coefficient.
- Trade flow and trade risk are additional measures of flow that will prove useful in our discussion on optimization.

\subsection*{Implementation Efficiency}

Results for this subsection are developed in Appendix A. We start with the transfer coefficient of Clarke, de Silva, and Thorley (2002). The transfer coefficient is the correlation of $M$ and $P$. We have the surprisingly simple result relating the transfer coefficient of $P$, denoted $\rho_{P, M}$, to $d$ and $g .{ }^{8}$
$$
\begin{equation*}
\rho_{P, M}=\sqrt{\frac{d}{d+g}} . \tag{10}
\end{equation*}
$$

\footnotetext{
8. A caution. This is only true if portfolio $M$ has maximum $I R$. We can assume this to be true in the case of one signal. In the case of multiple signals, the model/target portfolio does not have maximum $I R$.
}

The intuition is correct. Portfolio $P$ is less efficient if the information moves faster ( $g$ increases) and the speed of trading is held fixed. Correspondingly, $P$ becomes more efficient as the speed of trading $(d)$ increases while the speed of information flow is fixed. The transfer coefficient is a precost concept, so it is not sensitive to any adverse effects of increasing the speed of trading.

The transfer coefficient is of interest since the information ratio of $P$ (precost) is equal to the transfer coefficient times the information ratio of $M$; the relationship is: ${ }^{9}$
$$
\begin{equation*}
I R_{P}=\rho_{P, M} \cdot I R_{M} \tag{11}
\end{equation*}
$$

Let $\omega_{P}$ be the risk level of $P$ and $\omega_{M}$ the risk level of $M$. The laws of motion imply that:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\omega_{P}=\sqrt{\frac{d}{d+g}} \cdot \omega_{M}=\rho_{P, M} \cdot \omega_{M} . \tag{12}
\end{equation*}
$$

There is another way to view Equation (12). We can split $P$ 's holdings into a piece that is perfectly correlated with $M$ and a portion called $\mathbf{r}(t)$ for residual that is uncorrelated with $M$. The partition is:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{p}(t)=\frac{d}{d+g} \cdot \mathbf{m}(t)+\mathbf{r}(t) \tag{13}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus $d /(d+g)$ is the beta of $P$ with respect to $M$. The two parts of the portfolio in Equation (13) are uncorrelated, so we can see, using Equations (10) and (12), that a fraction $d /(d+g)$ of $P$ 's variance is compensated risk and, on the glass empty side, a fraction of $P$ 's risk budget, $g /(d+g)$, is spent with no compensating expected return.

We get yet another perspective on implementation effectiveness by considering the backlog, $P-M$, mentioned previously. The backlog is the trade we would make if we were given a one-time holiday from transactions costs. The risk of the backlog is the standard deviation of the return difference between $M$ and $P$, denoted by $\omega_{M-P}$. With our laws of motion, the backlog risk is:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\omega_{M-P}=\sqrt{\frac{g}{d}} \cdot \omega_{P}=\sqrt{\frac{g}{d+g}} \cdot \omega_{M} . \tag{14}
\end{equation*}
$$

Once again, faster-moving information hurts and, at least precost, faster trading helps.

}


\subsection*{Age Profile}

The results in this subsection are derived in Appendix C of this chapter. The idea is to determine the exposure of $M$ and $P$ to information according to its age. Information flows into and out of $M$. From the perspective of time $t$, the information that arrived at time $t-j \cdot \Delta t$ that is captured by $\mathbf{u}(t-j \cdot \Delta t)$ is now $j \cdot \Delta t$ years old. At time $t$, the model is a mixture of these past bundles of information. If we use $\gamma=e^{-g \cdot \Delta t}$ as per Equation (6) we obtain:
$\mathbf{m}(t)=\mathbf{u}(t)+\gamma \cdot \mathbf{u}(t-\Delta t)+\gamma^{2} \cdot \mathbf{u}(t-2 \cdot \Delta t)+\cdots+\gamma^{j} \cdot \mathbf{u}(t-j \cdot \Delta t)+\cdots$.
The sum of the exposures in Equation (15) is $1 /(1-\gamma)$. The fractional exposure at age $j \cdot \Delta t$ is $(1-\gamma) \cdot \gamma^{j}$. The weighted average age exposure of the information in $M$ is:
$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{M}=\frac{1}{g} . \tag{16}
\end{equation*}
$$

We can apply the same analysis to $P$. Write $P$ at time $t$ as:
$\mathbf{p}(t)=a_{0} \cdot \mathbf{u}(t)+a_{1} \cdot \mathbf{u}(t-\Delta t)+a_{2} \cdot \mathbf{u}(t-2 \cdot \Delta t)+\cdots+a_{j} \cdot \mathbf{u}(t-j \cdot \Delta t)+\cdots$
Equations (6) and (15) can be used to solve for the $a_{i}$. The result when $d \neq g$ is: ${ }^{10}$
$$
\begin{equation*}
a_{j}=\frac{1-\delta}{\delta-\gamma} \cdot\left\{\delta^{j+1}-\gamma^{j+1}\right\} . \tag{18}
\end{equation*}
$$

The $a_{j}$ also sum to $1 /(1-\gamma)$ so $(1-\gamma) \cdot a_{j}$ is the fraction of information in $P$ of age $j \cdot \Delta t$.

\footnotetext{
10. Appendix C of this chapter has the derivation including the special case $d=g$.
}

Exhibit 2 shows the fraction of information in the model and portfolio at each age.

EXHIBIT 2 The Exposure to Information by Each Age Point for $M$ and $P$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_02_02_3017336a66f43a9545b3g-161.jpg?height=658&width=1142&top_left_y=1090&top_left_x=176)

In this example $g=2.54$ and $d=2.96$.
In Exhibit 2, M's exposure is also the ability of that information to add value. Recent information is fresh and powerful; old information is stale and weak. This ability to add value declines geometrically in lockstep with M's exposure; $M$ does not waste any effort. $P$, in contrast, is slow to react to the new information, so it is underexposed to the more powerful recent information, in this case up to four months. $P$ is also overexposed to the older information. It is slow in shedding the positions that it built up although they are now largely depleted of any ability to add value.

As with $M$ we can calculate a weighted average age for the information in $P$. The result is:
$$
\begin{equation*}
A_{P}=\frac{1}{d}+\frac{1}{g}=\frac{1}{d}+A_{M}=\frac{d+g}{g \cdot d} \tag{19}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus $P$ is $1 / d$ years behind the curve when we use the trading rule, Equation (5). Equation (19), along with Equation (16), sheds light on the prior results, Equations (4) and (20), on the precost information ratios of $M$ and $P$.

If we combine Equations (11), (10), and (4), we get:
$$
\begin{equation*}
I R_{P}=I C \cdot \sqrt{N} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{d \cdot g}{d+g}} \tag{20}
\end{equation*}
$$

However, from Equations (19) and (4), we see the information ratios can be expressed in terms of the age of the information in the portfolio:
$$
\begin{equation*}
I R_{M}=\frac{I C \cdot \sqrt{N}}{\sqrt{A_{M}}}, \quad I R_{P}=\frac{I C \cdot \sqrt{N}}{\sqrt{A_{P}}} . \tag{21}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equation (21) illustrates the unobserved opportunity loss inherent in transactions costs. The costs slow down our trading and therefore age the information in $P$. Equation (21) also allows us to connect the transfer coefficient to the relative age of information in $M$ and $P$ :
$$
\begin{equation*}
\rho_{P, M}=\sqrt{\frac{A_{M}}{A_{P}}} \tag{22}
\end{equation*}
$$

\subsection*{Trade Flow and Trade Risk}

The results in this subsection are derived in Appendices C and A. They are useful in the section on optimization. If $\Delta \mathbf{p}(t)$ is the change in $P$ in the period from $t$ to $t+\Delta t$ then the ratio $\Delta \mathrm{p}(t) / \Delta t$ is the annual rate of change, what we will call the trade flow. The unconditional expected value of the trade flow is zero since at any time we are equally likely to be buying or selling any asset. We will use variance as a norm for trade flow and call the standard deviation of the trade flow the trade risk. If $\mathbf{V}$ is the $N$ by $N$ asset covariance matrix then the trade variance is:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\omega_{\{\Delta P / \Delta t\}}^{2} \equiv \omega_{\dot{P}}^{2} \equiv E\left\langle\frac{\Delta \mathbf{p}^{\prime}}{\Delta t} \cdot \mathbf{V} \cdot \frac{\Delta \mathbf{p}}{\Delta t}\right\rangle \tag{23}
\end{equation*}
$$

The trade risk measures both the speed of trading and the risk of the assets that we are trading. The laws of motion link the trade risk to the portfolio risk and backlog risk, Equation (14), as follows:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\omega_{\dot{P}}=\sqrt{g \cdot d} \cdot \omega_{P}=d \cdot \omega_{M-P} \tag{24}
\end{equation*}
$$

Note the similarity to the stock and flow relationship, Equation (9).

\section*{5. Optimality}

The analysis above indicated how the laws of motion determine many important characteristics of the portfolio. It is natural to ask if there is an optimal way to select the parameters $d$ and $g$. The answers are: "Yes" and "Not really." Yes in the case of $d$ as we develop in the remainder of this section and not really in the case of $g$. An optimal choice of $g$, to the extent such a choice is possible, is a strategic exercise involving reweighting sources of information or reengineering the information to have a longer shelf life. The theory, as we demonstrate toward the close of this section, affords a strategic context for that exercise. Technical support for this section can be found in Appendix E of this chapter.

\subsection*{Optimal Trade Rate}

In section 4 we showed that a larger value of $d$ leads to a higher transfer coefficient, a more effective use of the risk budget, and lower backlog risk. However, there is no free lunch. A higher value of $d$ means more trading, Equation (9), and most certainly higher trading cost. The challenge is to find the trade-off between the cost of trading and rewards from being in a high information ratio portfolio.

The objective is the annual risk-adjusted expected returns less annual costs. In algebraic form:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{O}_{P} \equiv \alpha_{P}-\frac{\lambda}{2} \cdot \omega_{P}^{2}-c_{P} \tag{25}
\end{equation*}
$$
where:
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\alpha_{P} & \text { expected annual alpha of portfolio } P \\
\omega_{P} & \text { annual risk of portfolio } P \\
\frac{\lambda}{2} \cdot \omega_{P}^{2} & \text { penalty (loss in alpha) due to risk }  \tag{26}\\
\alpha_{P}-\frac{\lambda}{2} \cdot \omega_{P}^{2} & \text { annual risk adjusted or certainty equivalent expected return } \\
c_{P} & \text { annual cost of trading needed to support portfolio } P
\end{array}
$$

The criterion is the annual alpha, $\alpha_{P}$, adjusted for risk, $\{\lambda / 2\} \cdot \omega_{p}^{2}$, and the annual transaction cost, $c_{P}$. Given the speed of information flow, $g$, we need to choose the speed of trading, $d$, and the level of model risk $\omega_{M}$ to specify an optimal operating policy. ${ }^{11}$

The criterion is completely specified once we have a definition of the annual trading costs, $c_{P}$. To make Equation (25) solvable, the annual $\operatorname{cost} c_{P}$ has to have a reasonable and functional form. To this end we assume that
11. It would be more natural and equivalent to use portfolio risk. However, the problem separates nicely when we use model risk. Equation (12) is used to move from one to the other.
the annual cost is proportional to the trade risk that was introduced in section 4. Thus:
$$
\begin{equation*}
c_{P}=\frac{\chi}{2} \cdot \omega_{\dot{p}}^{2} \tag{27}
\end{equation*}
$$

This is both crude and convenient. It is crude since it is a rough approximation of reality. It is convenient in that it affords an extraordinary harvest of insight into the dynamics of portfolio management. Rough as the assumption, Equation (27), might be, it does capture a few basic points about trading costs: ${ }^{12}$
- Costs are superlinear. Double the rate of trading and you will more than double the cost of trading.
- Riskier assets are generally more expensive to trade than less risky assets.
- A hedged basket of securities, say, balanced by industry, is cheaper to trade than an un-hedged basket.

What are we to make of this parameter $\chi$ ? Is 0.001 or $1,000.0$ an appropriate value? For the moment we will let $\chi$ remain enigmatic. At the close of the section we show how one might infer a reasonable range of values for $\chi$.

From section 4's results, Equation (24), we can express the cost, Equation (27), in terms of the portfolio risk and the parameters $g$ and $d$ :
$$
\begin{equation*}
c_{P}=\frac{\chi}{2} \cdot g \cdot d \cdot \omega_{P}^{2} . \tag{28}
\end{equation*}
$$

With the criterion, Equation (25), fully specified we can derive (see Appendix E) an optimal value of $d$. This optimal value of $d$ (denoted $\hat{d}$ ) and the consequent value of the crucial ratio $d /(d+g)$ are:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\hat{d}=\sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{\chi}}, \frac{\hat{d}}{\hat{d}+g}=\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+g \cdot \sqrt{\lambda \cdot \chi}} . \tag{29}
\end{equation*}
$$

As one would anticipate, large costs imply slower trading. More interesting is that a smaller penalty for risk means faster trading. That is because the theory implies, see Equation (12), that $\omega_{P}=\rho_{P, M} \cdot \omega_{M}$, so an increase in $d$ will also increase $\rho_{P, M}$ and thus $\omega_{P}$. It is also notable that $\hat{d}$ is selected independently of $g$.

The optimal level of M's risk depends upon the choice of $\hat{d}$, Equation (29), the speed of information flow $g$, the penalty for risk, $\lambda$, and the information's potential for adding value as captured by $I R_{M}$. That optimal level $\omega_{\mathrm{M}}$ is:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\omega_{M}=\frac{I R_{M}}{\lambda+g \cdot \sqrt{\lambda \cdot \chi}}=\frac{\hat{d}}{\hat{d}+g} \cdot \frac{I R_{M}}{\lambda} . \tag{30}
\end{equation*}
$$

\footnotetext{
12. See Grinold (2006) for additional discussion of this cost assumption.
}

Given $g$ and $\hat{d}$ from Equation (29), the transfer coefficient $\rho_{P, M}$ is known using Equation (10). The remaining components of the optimized strategy are easily calculated:
$$
\begin{align*}
\omega_{P} & =\rho_{P, M} \cdot \omega_{M} \\
\alpha_{P} & =\rho_{P, M} \cdot I R_{M} \cdot \omega_{P}  \tag{31}\\
c_{P} & =\frac{\chi}{2} \cdot g \cdot \hat{d} \cdot \omega_{P}^{2}
\end{align*}
$$

The after-cost information ratio is:
$$
\begin{equation*}
A C I R_{P}=\frac{\alpha_{P}-c_{P}}{\omega_{P}}=\rho_{P, M} \cdot I R \cdot\left\{1-\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{g}{\hat{d}+g}\right\} \tag{32}
\end{equation*}
$$

Finally, we can write the optimal objective value as a function of $g$ and the ability of the information to add value as captured by $I R$ :
$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{O}_{P}=\frac{I R^{2}}{2 \cdot \lambda} \cdot\left\{\frac{\hat{d}}{\hat{d}+g}\right\}^{2}=\frac{I R^{2}}{2 \cdot \lambda} \cdot \rho_{P, M}^{4} \tag{33}
\end{equation*}
$$

This analysis, in particular Equation (33), helps us in seeking an improved speed of information flow. If we keep the penalty for risk $\lambda$ and cost parameter $\chi$ constant then we can use Equation (33) to determine the pairs $(g, I R)$ have the same value of $O_{P}$ as a base case. ${ }^{13}$ The situation is illustrated in Exhibit 3.

EXHIBIT 3
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_02_02_3017336a66f43a9545b3g-165.jpg?height=631&width=1138&top_left_y=1130&top_left_x=178)

Note: Base case, the diamond, has information ratio of 2.0 and $g=2.1$. The breakeven curve shows $(g, I R)$ pairs with the same value of $O_{p}$ as the base case. We are better off above the breakeven curve and worse below. If we slow the model so that $g=1$ and the $I R$ slips to 1.5 (the star) then we will be better off.

\footnotetext{
13. We can take this a step further. Recall from Equation (4) that $I R^{2}=I C^{2} \cdot g \cdot N$. With this substitution we can make it an IC and $g$ trade-off.
}

We return to the question of a reasonable value for the t -cost parameter $\chi$. Let $c_{P}^{*}\left(\chi, \lambda, g, I R_{M}\right)$ be the annual level of costs when we follow the optimal policy determined by Equations (29) and (30). If we consider $c_{P}^{*}\left(\chi, \lambda, g, I R_{M}\right)$ as a function of $\chi$, the optimal annual costs will increase (costs are inelastic) until we reach a critical level $\chi=\bar{\chi}$ from that point on further increases in $\chi$ will lead to decreases in the annual costs paid (costs are elastic). The tipping point, $\chi=\bar{\chi}$, is easily calculated:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\bar{\chi}=\frac{\lambda}{4 \cdot g^{2}} \tag{34}
\end{equation*}
$$

With this level of the transactions cost parameter the optimal trading rate, from Equation (29), is $\hat{d}=2 \cdot g$ and the ratio $\hat{d} /(\hat{d}+g)$ is $2 / 3$. Costs are a maximum point in this case:
$$
\begin{equation*}
c_{P}^{*}\left(\chi, \lambda, g, I R_{M}\right) \leq\left\{\frac{4}{9}\right\} \cdot\left\{\frac{I R^{2}}{2 \cdot \lambda}\right\} \tag{35}
\end{equation*}
$$

Exhibit 4 illustrates the effect.

In the next section we demonstrate how the process can be reversed. We start with observed values of $g$ and $d$ plus the strategy's risk level $\omega_{p}$. Combine these with an assumed value of information, $I R_{M}$, and we can infer the value of both $\chi$ and $\lambda$.

\section*{6. Dynamic Portfolio Analysis}

We can use the results of sections 4 and 5 to examine the dynamic properties of an investment strategy. This is not performance analysis; we are not trying to relate these ideas to the nature or sources of investment return. ${ }^{14}$ Instead, we want to know if we are moving the portfolio about in a sensible and efficient manner. The analysis should lead to a new understanding of the strategy and possibly to improvements in performance. We will, in line with the theory, select a long-short strategy that is relatively unconstrained for an example. This section takes us step by step through an analysis. There are three questions to consider:
- What are the dynamic characteristics $(g, d)$ of the strategy?
- What are the consequences of those characteristics?
- Can we improve matters?

\subsection*{Data}

The required data for time $t$ :
- $\mathbf{V}(t)$ is the covariance matrix.
- $\mathbf{m}(t)$ is the model/target portfolio.
- $\mathbf{p}(t)$ is the portfolio.

These represent a set of (preferably) evenly spaced dates. The covariance matrices are available from various vendors. In most cases there will be data that describes the portfolio $\mathbf{p}(t)$. It may be a challenge to reconstruct the model, $\mathrm{m}(t) .{ }^{15}$ If we don't have a model history but we do have a history of alpha forecasts, $\alpha(t)$, and we know a reasonable target risk level for the model, $\omega_{M}$, we can use: ${ }^{16}$
$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{m}(t)=\omega_{M} \cdot \frac{\mathbf{V}^{-1}(t) \cdot \alpha(t)}{\sqrt{\alpha^{\prime}(t) \cdot \mathbf{V}^{-1}(t) \cdot \alpha(t)}} \tag{36}
\end{equation*}
$$

\subsection*{Time Horizon}

The goal is to estimate behavior that is average for most of the assets most of the time. Recall this is the view from 33,000 feet. We should choose an estimation interval that is long relative to the rebalance interval. This will allow time for matters to average out. If we have too short an estimation interval, we will be plagued by microstructure effects such as asynchronous and lumpy arrival of data, ${ }^{17}$ liquidity twists and turns, and trading that often focuses on a small subset of the assets at any particular time. To that end we estimate changes over a lag $L$ that is large compared to the rebalance interval $\Delta t$. In the case of our example, the rebalance interval is daily, and we have taken the interval between observations to be one month, $L=1 / 12$.

\footnotetext{
14. The notions described in this paper could be used in performance analysis.
15. Indeed, one of the objects of this effort is to encourage managers to retain the data that will enable the use of dynamic portfolio analysis.
16. If we think the changes in $\kappa^{2}(t)=\alpha^{\prime}(t) \cdot \mathbf{V}^{-1}(t) \cdot \boldsymbol{\alpha}(t)$ from period to period are meaningful, then you

17. There is a fringe benefit of this analysis if we can see how to smooth and rationalize the inflow of information to the strategy.
}

\subsection*{Estimation}

We'll start with $g$. Consider this variation on the law of motion, Equation (6):
$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{m}(t)=\gamma(t) \cdot \mathbf{m}(t-L)+\mathbf{u}(t) \tag{37}
\end{equation*}
$$

We select $\gamma(t)$ so that $\mathbf{m}(t-L)$ and $\mathbf{u}(t)$ are uncorrelated; in other words:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{m}(t-L) \cdot \mathbf{V}(t) \cdot \mathbf{u}(t)=0 \tag{38}
\end{equation*}
$$

The condition Equation (38) is guaranteed if:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\gamma(t)=\frac{\mathbf{m}(t-L) \cdot \mathbf{V}(t) \cdot \mathbf{m}(t)}{\mathbf{m}(t-L) \cdot \mathbf{V}(t) \cdot \mathbf{m}(t-L)} \tag{39}
\end{equation*}
$$

This value of $\gamma(t)$ produces a point estimate of $g$ through the transform:
$$
\begin{equation*}
g(t)=-\ln (\gamma(t)) / L \tag{40}
\end{equation*}
$$

The jagged line in Exhibit 5 shows a time series of point estimates $g(t)$ for a long-short strategy. As mentioned above the portfolios are rebalanced daily and the estimation period, $L$, was one month. The second line in Exhibit 5 is an exponentially smoothed version of the same data. ${ }^{18}$ In the early dot-com years the information was moving rapidly with an average age of 1.5 to 2 months. There is interlude from 1999 through 2004 where the information flow gradually slows. Since 2004 it appears to have stabilized with an average age of 4 to 5 months.

\footnotetext{
18. These are $g_{s}(t)=\phi \cdot g_{s}(t-T)+(1-\phi) \cdot g(t)$ with $g_{s}(1)=g(1)$ and $\ln (\phi)=\{T / H L\} \cdot \ln (0.5)$ where $H L$ is the half-life. In our case, $H L=0.5$ ( 6 months).
}

EXHIBIT 5 Point Estimates of the Parameter $g$ and an Exponentially Smoothed Version of the Same Data.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_02_02_3017336a66f43a9545b3g-168.jpg?height=633&width=1146&top_left_y=1360&top_left_x=176)

Exhibit 5 illustrates three points:
- Examine the strategy over a reasonable period of time. The crosssectional estimates are noisy, and the process evolves, so a snapshot is likely to be misleading.
- Don't expect laser-like precision. You will obtain reasonable estimates: 2.5 is different from 3.5 but about the same as 2.7 or 2.3.
- There is value in a long estimation window (large $L$ ). In our example we might have gone longer still, say one quarter, $L=0.25$. The asynchronous arrival of data (think earnings season) causes uneven changes in the model when examined at the monthly level.

We can obtain an estimate of $d$ in a similar but slightly more complicated way. Consider the following system:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{p}(t)=\delta(t) \cdot \mathbf{p}(t-L)+\theta(t) \cdot \mathbf{m}(t)+\varepsilon(t) \tag{41}
\end{equation*}
$$

We want the residual, $\varepsilon(t)$, in Equation (41) to be uncorrelated with $\mathrm{p}(t-L)$ and $\mathbf{m}(t)$. This requirement is expressed as:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{m}^{\prime}(t) \cdot \mathbf{V}(t) \cdot \varepsilon(t)=0, \quad \mathbf{p}^{\prime}(t-L) \cdot \mathbf{V}(t) \cdot \varepsilon(t)=0 \tag{42}
\end{equation*}
$$

If we combine Equation (42) with Equation (41) we get two equations in the two unknowns, $\delta(t), \theta(t)$.

Our interest is centered on the estimate of $\delta(t)$. Since we will most likely not have a model $\mathrm{m}(t)$ that is scaled properly, we cannot expect much from $\theta(t)$. In particular, we should not anticipate that $\theta(t)=1-\delta(t)$. The point estimate of $d$ is:
$$
\begin{equation*}
d(t)=-\ln (\delta(t)) / L \tag{43}
\end{equation*}
$$

Exhibit 6 presents a time series of the point estimates $d(t)$ for the long-short strategy alluded to above. The second line in Exhibit 6 is an exponentially smoothed version of $d(t)$. This indicates that $P$ is somewhere between six months (when $d(t) \approx 2$ ) to three months (when $d(t) \approx 4$ ) behind $M$.

We compared the point estimates $d(t)$ with a history of the strategy's turnover (the flows of section 3) to see if spikes in Exhibit 6 corresponded to periods of rapid trading. They did.

\subsection*{A Sensibility Check}

We can check the estimates by comparing the predicted transfer coefficient, Equation (10), with the actual, since the data, $\mathbf{m}(t), \mathbf{V}(t), \mathbf{p}(t)$ allows us to directly calculate the correlation of $M$ and $P$ in any cross section. The directly calculated transfer coefficient is denoted $\rho_{P, M}(t)$, where:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\rho_{P, M}(t)=\frac{\mathbf{m}^{\prime}(t) \cdot \mathbf{V}(t) \cdot \mathbf{p}(t)}{\sqrt{\mathbf{m}^{\prime}(t) \cdot \mathbf{V}(t) \cdot \mathbf{m}(t)} \cdot \sqrt{\mathbf{p}^{\prime}(t) \cdot \mathbf{V}(t) \cdot \mathbf{p}(t)}} . \tag{44}
\end{equation*}
$$

Exhibit 7 contains the comparison of the $\rho_{P, M}(t)$ and $\rho_{P, M}$ from Equation (10) using the exponentially smoothed estimates of $d$ and $g$.

EXHIBIT 6 The Point Estimates of $d$ and an Exponentially Smoothed Version of the Estimates.

EXHIBIT 7 The Transfer Coefficient as Calculated Directly and Inferred by the Dynamic Theory
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_02_02_3017336a66f43a9545b3g-170.jpg?height=666&width=1144&top_left_y=1020&top_left_x=177)

As we can see from Exhibit 7, we get off to a bad start since (see Exhibits 5 and 6) there is a great deal of initial instability in our estimates of $d$ and $g$. From 2007 onward the results are encouraging. The prediction tracks reality fairly closely. The theoretical results tend to lag the cross sectional estimates because of the natural delay built in by the exponential smoothing of the values of $d$ and $g$.

\subsection*{An Alternative}

There is an indirect direct way to estimate $g$ and $d$. Suppose that we monitor the rebalancing trades made in the portfolio, $\Delta \mathrm{p}(t) .{ }^{19}$ Given the covariance matrix $\mathbf{V}(t)$ we can calculate the trade risk as in Equation (23). Let $\omega_{\dot{p}}$ (with a dot over the $P$ ) be an average value of trade risk. Then, given the estimate of the transfer coefficient $\rho_{P, M}$ from Equation (44) and P's risk, $\omega_{P}$, bolstered by Equation (24) linking $\omega_{\dot{P}}$ and $\omega_{P}$ we can estimate $g$ and $d$ as follows:
$$
\begin{equation*}
g=\frac{\omega_{\dot{P}}}{\omega_{P}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1-\rho_{P, M}^{2}}{\rho_{P, M}^{2}}}, \quad d=\frac{\omega_{\dot{P}}}{\omega_{P}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\rho_{P, M}^{2}}{1-\rho_{P, M}^{2}}} . \tag{45}
\end{equation*}
$$

\subsection*{Portfolio Attributes}

With the estimated values of $d$ and $g$ and two more items:
- The risk of the portfolio $\omega_{P}$
- An estimate of the model's information ratio $I R_{M}=I R$
we can assess other important characteristics of the portfolio based on the results in section 4. The data for our example is in Exhibit 8.

EXHIBIT 8 Predicted Characteristics of the Portfolio Based on the Results in Section 4
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ ITEM } & VALUE & SOURCE \\
\hline IR & 1.75 & assume \\
\hline omega (P) & $4.50 \%$ & observe \\
\hline$d$ & 3.00 & estimate \\
\hline$g$ & 2.50 & estimate \\
\hline rho (P,M) & 0.74 & theory \\
\hline IR (P) & 1.29 & theory \\
\hline Age (M) & 0.40 & theory \\
\hline Age (P) & 0.73 & theory \\
\hline omega (P_dot) & $12.32 \%$ & theory \\
\hline omega (M-P) & $4.11 \%$ & theory \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The first four rows in the table are the inputs to the analysis. We assume, as noted above, the potential of the information to add value, in our case $I R=$ 1.75. This, of course, should be based on data and rational expectations. We can observe the risk of the strategy (in our case $4.5 \%$ ) and as discussed above we can make estimates of $d$ and $g$ or we could use "what if" values of $d$ and $g$ to gauge the sensitivity of results to possible changes. The remaining items in the table are calculated respectively as per Equations (10), (11), (16), (19), (24), and (14).

\footnotetext{
19. To avoid confusion, one should filter out (or prorate) trades motivated by capital inflow or outflow.
}

\subsection*{Inferred Values of $\lambda$ and $\chi$.}

We can take the analysis a step further and use the results in section 5 to back out the penalty for risk $\lambda$ and a t-cost level $\chi$ that are consistent with the data in Exhibit 8.

If we combine Equations (10), (12), and (30) we see that:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\lambda=\frac{d}{d+g} \cdot \frac{I R}{\omega_{M}}=\left\{\frac{d}{d+g}\right\}^{3 / 2} \cdot \frac{I R}{\omega_{P}} . \tag{46}
\end{equation*}
$$

From here is it is easy, using the estimate of $d$, to infer that:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\chi=\frac{\lambda}{d^{2}} . \tag{47}
\end{equation*}
$$

With these data and the results in section 5 we can predict the outcomes for the portfolio.

These are shown in Exhibit 9.
EXHIBIT 9 Additional Analysis of the Portfolio Based on an Assumption That the Portfolio Risk $\omega_{p}$ and Trading Rate $d$ Are the Result of an Optimal Choice in the Manner Described in Section 5
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ ITEM } & VALUE & SOURCE \\
\hline lambda & 15.67 & infer \\
\hline chi & 1.74 & infer \\
\hline alpha & $5.82 \%$ & theory \\
\hline risk_pen & $1.59 \%$ & theory \\
\hline t_cost & $1.32 \%$ & theory \\
\hline O (P) & $2.91 \%$ & theory \\
\hline ACIR $(P)$ & 1.00 & theory \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The risk penalty referred to in Exhibit 9 is $\{\lambda / 2\} \cdot \omega_{P}^{2}$ and the t-cost is $c_{P}=\{\chi / 2\} \cdot \omega_{p}^{2}$. The objective value, $O_{P}$, comes from Equation (33) and the after-cost information ratio $\left(A C I R_{P}\right)$ from Equation (32).

\section*{7. Summary}

We have used portfolio analysis to capture the dynamic nature of an unconstrained (long-short) investment management strategy. It is a bare-bones system with only two parameters: the speed that information loses its forecasting power and the speed of trading. These parameters can be inferred from observing the positions and trades of a lightly constrained long-short strategy. The parameters $(g, d)$ are linked to familiar investment concepts. This minimalist setup yields a surprisingly abundant set of results. We can characterize the efficiency of the implementation, analyze and explain many aspects of the strategy, and optimize the rate of trading. More important
than the specific results is the change in perception. Looking at the portfolio as a moving object provides a new perspective and opens up other interesting possibilities.
