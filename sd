Below is a revised version of the lottery wheel builder code that meets your updated criteria but does not use frequency weighting in candidate generation. In this version, candidate tickets are generated uniformly at random and then filtered to ensure that they meet the following criteria:

1. **Sum Criterion:** The sum of the ticket’s numbers is between 140 and 190 (inclusive).  
2. **Odd Number Criterion:** The ticket contains at least 2 odd numbers and at most 4 odd numbers.  
3. **Small Number Criterion:** The ticket contains at least 2 numbers less than 25 and at most 4 such numbers.

All candidate generation is now done uniformly without any frequency weighting. The code uses a greedy algorithm to build the lottery wheel by selecting, in each iteration, the candidate ticket that covers the largest number of uncovered \(t\)-element subsets (represented as bitmasks).

Below is the complete code:

### Explanation

1. **Subset Extraction & Universe Generation:**  
   - The function `get_ticket_t_subsets` (with caching) computes all \(t\)-element subsets of a ticket and represents them as bitmasks.
   - The function `generate_universe` builds the full set of \(t\)-element subsets (as bitmasks) from numbers 1 to \(n\).

2. **Candidate Validity:**  
   - The `is_valid_candidate` function checks that a ticket’s sum lies between 140 and 190, contains between 2 and 4 odd numbers, and between 2 and 4 numbers less than 25.

3. **Candidate Generation:**  
   - The function `random_valid_candidate_ticket` generates a single ticket uniformly at random and returns it if it meets the criteria.
   - The function `generate_valid_candidates` repeatedly calls the above function until it collects a pool of valid candidate tickets.

4. **Evaluation and Greedy Selection:**  
   - The function `evaluate_candidate` determines how many uncovered \(t\)-subsets (bitmasks) a candidate ticket would cover.
   - The greedy loop in `build_lottery_wheel` selects the candidate that covers the most uncovered subsets, adds it to the wheel, and removes its covered subsets from the universe.

5. **Uniform Candidate Generation:**  
   - No frequency weighting is used—the candidate tickets are generated uniformly at random.

Feel free to adjust parameters such as `n`, `k`, `t`, and `sample_size` as needed. This version builds your lottery wheel using uniformly generated candidates that meet your specified criteria. Happy coding!
